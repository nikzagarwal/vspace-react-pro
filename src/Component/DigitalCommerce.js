    sales channels are aligned and present a single face to the customer, along with one consistent way of doing business</p>
                                <p>Customer purchase behavior has undergone a metamorphosis over the course of past few years.
                                  It is not just about the convenience of purchasing online and not even the price factor.
                                   Current customers are demanding "anywhere" and "everywhere" personalized facilitation from retailers.
                                   Retailers need to be not just multi-device and multi-channel  enabled but also deeply engaged and aware of
         each customer's purchase journey.  </p>
                                <p>Seamless integration of technologies and processes ensures that retailers have absolutely no friction shadowing
       customers as they interweave across multiple channels, online and offline,  as part of a single purchase flow.  </p>
